# Small Fish Tank

Description: This is a small fish tank that have two type of fish,
The pink fish is always follow the green fish.

Artist statement: The effect that I trying to do is making a cute fish tank.
However, I think the seaweed is a little bit weird but it looks ok to me.
For the fish part, I have try to change the code many times to make the pink fish 
staying along, but I did not suceed that, I can only make it follow the green fish.
